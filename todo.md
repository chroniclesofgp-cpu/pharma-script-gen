- [x] Update Tier-List execution guidance: off-camera prompt names every ingredient/format; on-camera pharmacist reacts and assigns the tier; no generic “S-tier product” placeholder

- [x] Create `CLEAN_SLATE_ACTIVE_SOURCE_MAP.md` and Master Context Section 25 to establish the pre-trial baseline, raw-archive boundary, just-in-time loading rule, fresh-rebuild contract, and sentence-level qualification-only policy
- [x] Validate the restored project, confirm deleted artifacts are absent, verify the active source map, and save the final clean-slate checkpoint (259/259 tests passing; all approved deletion targets absent; 12 raw-evidence files archived externally)

## Clean-Slate Rebuild Roadmap — September 1, 2026
- [x] Inventory the restored baseline, deleted active artifacts, and externally retained raw evidence needed for a fresh rebuild
- [x] Sequence the source-analysis, framework, product-intelligence, campaign, performance-tracking, and operating-document rebuilds in dependency order
- [x] Define approval gates, provenance requirements, and the just-in-time source set for each rebuild stage
- [x] Present the proposed rebuild plan with all script writing explicitly placed last; user approved the roadmap and starting point

## Approved Clean-Slate Rebuild Execution — September 1, 2026
- [x] Revalidate the pre-trial Type 1/Type 2 negative-apology and preliminary Type 4 scam-warning frameworks against their original creator evidence; preserve or revise only where source review supports it (`analysis/rebuild-frameworks/BOF_APOLOGY_REVALIDATION_CARD_2026-09-01.md`; `analysis/rebuild-frameworks/TYPE4_SCAM_WARNING_REVALIDATION_CARD_2026-09-01.md`)
- [x] Rebuild the Bundle Routine Walkthrough from three original user-supplied videos and register its fresh source-faithful framework card (`analysis/rebuild-frameworks/BUNDLE_ROUTINE_WALKTHROUGH_REVALIDATION_CARD_2026-09-01.md`)
- [x] Reanalyze the original Category Scorecard/Rating source video and create a fresh framework card capturing prompt-and-score execution, scoring scale, pacing, visual board, proof, and product/category fit (`analysis/rebuild-frameworks/CATEGORY_SCORECARD_REVALIDATION_CARD_2026-09-01.md`)
- [x] Reanalyze the original Do/Don’t, Best-Last List, and numeric-ranking source videos; classify each only after fresh source review as an independent framework or a variation (`analysis/rebuild-frameworks/DO_DONT_CONTRAST_REVALIDATION_CARD_2026-09-01.md`; `NUMERIC_SCORECARD_VARIATION_REVALIDATION_CARD_2026-09-01.md`; `BEST_LAST_LIST_REVALIDATION_CARD_2026-09-01.md`)
- [x] Create a neutral Product X verification sheet showing the minimal repeatable output for each rebuilt framework, with no real-product claim or legacy intelligence influence (`analysis/rebuild-frameworks/PRODUCT_X_FRAMEWORK_TEST_SHEET_2026-09-01.md`)
- [x] Present the Product X sheet and use user feedback to approve, revise, or reject each rebuilt framework before progressing to product-research rebuilds; user approved the structures with the short-apology feature-to-benefit-to-problem refinement
- [x] Add the permanent Competitive Decision Map requirement to the decision frameworks and fact-only research protocol: source common real alternatives, their narrow roles, recognizable frustrations, and truthful limitations; permit multiple 8/10+ linked winners only when their use cases differ (`analysis/rebuild-frameworks/COMPETITIVE_DECISION_MAP_STANDARD_2026-09-01.md`)
- [x] Rebuild the fact-only product-research operating requirements, including exact-product video benchmarking and fair category-competition research (`FACT_ONLY_PRODUCT_RESEARCH_PROTOCOL.md`)
- [x] Verify and restore verbatim top-comment capture from top-performing exact-product videos, including source link/rank, engagement context, and authentic downstream uses for objection handling and comment-reply planning (`FACT_ONLY_PRODUCT_RESEARCH_PROTOCOL.md`, Section 3.5)
- [x] Rebuild priority product intelligence and product-specific campaign plans one product at a time from original sources, beginning with the user-selected product — completed for Dr. Dent and DryWater; future products remain source-gated
- [x] Reconstruct only user-confirmed performance learning from raw metrics when a future framework or campaign decision needs it — retained as a gated operating rule; no unsupported performance claims added in this audit
- [x] Write new scripts only after the relevant framework, fact-only product intelligence, and campaign plan are freshly approved — applied to the approved DryWater campaign; future campaigns remain gated
- [x] Add the permanent context-reset control requiring just-in-time reload of every critical governing, source, fact, and quality document before analysis, documentation, or drafting continues
- [x] Rebuild the deleted Dr. Dent Purple Toothpaste Tablets fact-only intelligence record from the physical tin, current primary sources, reviews, complete product-video review, verbatim comments, evidence, and a Competitive Decision Map; do not create campaign or script content (`product-intel/dr-dent-purple-toothpaste-tablets-fact-record.md`; documented access limits for top comments and full-video/view data)
- [x] Resolve the user-supplied TikTok short URL and build a fact-only intelligence record for that exact product/variant/seller from current primary sources, reviews, complete product-video review, verbatim comments, evidence, and a Competitive Decision Map; do not create campaign or script content (`product-intel/drywater-complete-daily-electrolyte-vitamin-powder-fact-record.md`; documented exact-variant panel, comment, view, and full-video access limits)
- [x] Validate both new fact-only product intelligence records against the active protocol, run the automated test suite, save a checkpoint, and present the completed records for user review before campaign planning (both records pass the fact-boundary completion gates with documented source limitations; `pnpm test`: 12 files / 259 tests passed on September 1, 2026)
- [x] Reload the full six-document script-writing reference set, completed DryWater fact record, and applicable fresh framework cards before evaluating a DryWater campaign
- [x] Validate the proposed DryWater comparison, expert-verdict, and ranking decision sets against current original sources and the Competitive Decision Map; include only recognizable alternatives with supported roles and limitations (`research/drywater_campaign_source_log_2026-09-01.md`; Type 4 confirmed Path B only absent current counterfeit/seller-mismatch evidence)
- [x] Draft a source-grounded DryWater campaign plan that includes the mandatory BOF suite, a comparison option, an expert-verdict option, and eligible ranking formats; keep script writing gated on user approval (`campaign-plans/drywater-complete-daily-electrolyte-vitamin-powder-campaign-proposal.md`)
- [x] Present the DryWater campaign plan for user approval, update the rebuild ledger, run validation, and save a checkpoint before writing any DryWater scripts (user approved September 2, 2026; planning checkpoint `2b437722`)
- [x] Write the approved DryWater 10-asset campaign package using framework-faithful documented openings, structures, buyer-psychology levers, proof-card plans, and proven creator CTAs; re-open the source set after any context reset (`scripts/campaigns/DRYWATER_RASPBERRY_LEMON_campaign.md`; fidelity map and campaign/source indexes registered)
- [x] Perform a line-by-line framework, claim-source, buyer-psychology, CTA, proof-card, and filming-day-variable review of the DryWater script package; run the automated test suite and save a checkpoint before delivery (package-wide quality checklist passed 18/18; focused DryWater documentation regression test added; full suite 13 files / 263 tests passed)
- [x] Re-audit all ten DryWater scripts for the user-identified failure modes: defensive water framing outside the one legitimate comparison, repetitive high-potassium pharmacist flags, and underused verified product differentiators (`analysis/drywater_script_quality_root_cause_2026-09-02.md`)
- [x] Rewrite the DryWater campaign to make its no-added-sugar, no-artificial-ingredient, real-fruit, electrolyte-profile, and portable-format advantages the product-specific conversion engine; restrict water to the single contextual comparison in which DryWater is the clear relevant-use-case winner (Version 3 replaces the initial package)
- [x] Revalidate the revised DryWater package against the full script-writing source set, framework-fidelity map, fact record, and filming-day facts; run tests, save a checkpoint, and present the corrected scripts for review (V3 source and substantive review complete; production build passed; `pnpm test`: 14 files / 267 tests passed; checkpoint `6999a636`)
- [x] Trace the DryWater repetition and weak-positioning failure against the existing no-redundancy/product-advancement rule, fidelity map, package quality audit, and actual script language; document the root causes (`analysis/drywater_script_quality_root_cause_2026-09-02.md`)
- [x] Strengthen the permanent script-writing controls so every beat has an assigned new-information, buyer-payoff, objection-resolution, proof, retention, or CTA job and so product-specific differentiators cannot be displaced by repetitive caveats (Rule E.1 added to `SCRIPT_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`; Item 13a added to `POST_WRITE_CHECKLIST.md`; quality reviewer expanded and outcomes retained in `server/routers/tiktok.ts`; new focused regression test passes)
- [x] Expose retained script-quality review results in the generation interface and client contract so future writers can see failed Rule E/product-advancement checks instead of mistaking a structural test for substantive approval (`client/src/lib/scriptData.ts`, `client/src/pages/Home.tsx`, `server/routers/tiktok.ts`, and focused regression test)
- [x] Rebuild and re-audit the DryWater package under the corrected controls, with water restricted to its one contextual comparison and high-potassium guidance restricted to the single relevant script, before presenting it for review (V3 substantive review added to `analysis/drywater_script_quality_root_cause_2026-09-02.md`)
- [x] Reassess and rank DryWater’s best purchase reasons from the current exact-label source, shopper language, category alternatives, and accessible product-video evidence; treat the user’s observed selling points as hypotheses rather than final campaign facts (`analysis/drywater_purchase_reason_reassessment_2026-09-02.md`; exact Raspberry Lemon NSF certification independently verified and fact record refreshed)
- [x] Update the DryWater product-message hierarchy and all affected scripts with the strongest verified differentiators, then rerun source, framework, repetition, and automated-test validation before delivery (V3 package; `pnpm test`: 14 files / 267 tests passed; production build passed)
- [x] Locate exact comparison-video source candidates for Dr. Faith, rphreviews, and Riva from the active hook library, creator deep dives, and retained source links; do not assume an analysis excerpt is a full transcript
- [x] Verify and capture only complete spoken sequences from exact accessible comparison videos for each creator; record unavailable creators as unresolved rather than filling gaps (all three complete MP4 sources retrieved and transcribed)
- [x] Create one transcript-only Markdown document per creator containing only the complete verbatim spoken transcript, with no analysis, visual notes, overlays, or partial reconstruction (`research/comparison-transcripts/`)
- [x] Validate transcript completeness and source provenance, run tests, save a checkpoint, and deliver only verified complete transcript documents (three complete link-based captures; transcript-only marker audit passed; `pnpm test`: 14 files / 267 tests passed)
- [x] Re-run the Dr. Faith, rphreviews, and Riva comparison-transcript retrieval through the Master Context’s approved link-based deep-dive workflow, including complete spoken transcript and visual/overlay capture before reducing each deliverable to transcript-only
- [x] Create one transcript-only document per creator from the complete verified link-based captures; do not request screen recordings unless the governing workflow explicitly requires them after all approved retrieval routes are exhausted
- [x] Validate the three transcript documents for completeness and provenance, run tests, save a checkpoint, and deliver only the requested transcript files (all three verified; `pnpm test`: 14 files / 267 tests passed)
- [x] Reload the Master Context and inventory every active document used in script creation, including hook frameworks, architecture, buyer psychology, phrase bank, visual overlays, healthcare hooks, quality controls, campaign/fact records, and source maps (`analysis/script_writing_source_audit_inventory_2026-09-03.md`)
- [x] Inventory retained raw source evidence—transcripts, downloaded source media, URLs, captures, studies, comments, reviews, creator analyses, and framework revalidation records—and map each evidence class to the active documents it supports (`analysis/script_writing_source_audit_inventory_2026-09-03.md`; direct filesystem inventory completed)
- [x] Report the available audit corpus, provenance tiers, inaccessible or missing evidence, and an audit-ready review sequence before performing the substantive audit (`analysis/script_writing_source_audit_inventory_2026-09-03.md`; `pnpm test`: 14 files / 267 tests passed)
